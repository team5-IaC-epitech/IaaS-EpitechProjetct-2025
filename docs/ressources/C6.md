# **Course 6: Cloud SQL Databases & Secrets Management**

---

## **1\. Introduction**

In this course, we focus on two fundamental building blocks of cloud-native applications:

* **Managed Cloud Databases**: why we use them, their benefits, and how they integrate into cloud networking.

* **Secrets Management**: how to store and secure sensitive information like passwords, API keys, and tokens in a cloud-native way.

## **2\. Cloud Databases**

### **2.1 What Are Managed SQL Databases?**

* A **Managed SQL Database** is a fully managed relational database service provided by cloud providers.

* Instead of manually running a database server (e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server) on a VM, the cloud provider:

  * Handles provisioning, scaling, patching, and backups.  
  * Provides automated replication and high availability options.  
  * Integrates with the cloud VPC for private, secure connectivity.  
  * Offer native backup, permissions and lifecycle policies management.

### **2.2 Services**

* **Google Cloud** → **Cloud SQL** (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server).

* **AWS** → **Amazon RDS** (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, SQL Server).

### **2.3 Networking Integration**

* Databases are deployed **inside the VPC**.

* Applications running in Kubernetes clusters or VMs connect through **private IPs** or **service endpoints**.

* Public IPs can be enabled but are not recommended for production.

* Cloud IAM and firewall rules control **who and what can access** the database.

## **3\. Cloud Secrets Management**

### **3.1 What Is Secrets Management?**

* **Secrets** \= sensitive information needed by applications:

  * Database credentials  
  * API keys  
  * Certificates  
  * OAuth tokens  
  * Etc, anything sensible

Storing these in code or config files is insecure.  
A **Secrets Manager** provides a central, secure place to store, retrieve them and manage permissions.

### **3.2 Services**

* **Google Cloud** → **Secret Manager**.

* **AWS** → **Secrets Manager**.

### **3.3 Why Use Them?**

* Centralized and **encrypted at rest** (using KMS).

* Secrets are **rotatable** (credentials can be automatically updated).

* **IAM** for access permissions and **Audit logging** for access events.

* Remove the need to hardcode credentials in source code or configs.

### **3.4 Integration with Cloud IAM**

* Secrets Managers integrate seamlessly with **applications and services**:

  * Kubernetes pods, serverless functions, VMs.

  * Access is controlled using **IAM** (fine-grained permissions).

* Example:

  * An app running in GKE or EKS requests a DB password from Secret Manager.

  * IAM verifies the app’s identity.

  * The secret is delivered securely at runtime.

## **4\. Key Takeaways**

* **Managed SQL Databases** simplify database operations: automated scaling, patching, and backups, while integrating securely into the VPC.

* **Cloud Secrets Managers** provide a secure, centralized way to handle sensitive information.

* Both rely on **IAM integration** to enforce secure, least-privilege access.
