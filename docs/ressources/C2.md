# **C2: Introduction & IaC Fundamentals (Hands-On with Terraform)**

## **1\. Introduction**

In Course 1, you learned the **concepts of IaC, Terraform, and GitOps**.  
 Now, it’s time to get hands-on. By the end of this module, you will:

* Deploy a **VPC and subnet** on your cloud provider using Terraform.

* Use a **remote backend** for Terraform state.

* Test your setup **locally** with reproducible and disposable infrastructure.

* Learn to import, destroy, and redeploy your infrastructure with just a few commands.

⚠️ **Important**: Infrastructure must be managed responsibly. Always handle credentials with care. Each **region** has its own **costs (💸)**, **latency (⚡)**, and **environmental impact (🌍)**. Choose your deployment region carefully, balancing price, performance, and sustainability.

## **2\. Prerequisites**

Each group (4 students) must ensure the following before starting:

* **Local tools installed**:

  * Terraform CLI

  * Git CLI

  * Cloud provider CLI (AWS, GCP, or Azure)

* **Cloud project ready**:

  * One project per group (for **dev** environment).

  * Example: `${group_name}-iac-dev`.  
  * Credentials configured locally via the provider CLI:

         `aws configure`

         `gcloud auth login && gcloud auth application-default login`

         `az login`

*  ⚠️ **Never hardcode access keys or service account JSONs** in Terraform or GitHub.

  * In production, you would use **Identity Federation** with short-lived credentials.

    * 👉 **For simplicity, we will not use identity federation in this course.**

* **GitHub repository**: one per group, containing Terraform code.

* **Team organization**: groups are **autonomous** on how to split the work (providers, variables, backend setup, etc.).  
* Feel free to ask if your group needs assistance but **RTFM** \! Hashicorp Terraform and Cloud providers documentation are well written and contain all necessary information to achieve this exercise.

## **3\. Terraform Basics**

### **Providers**

`provider "aws" {`  
  `region = var.region`  
`}`

### **Variables**

`variables.tf`:

`variable "project_id" {`  
  `type        = string`  
  `description = "Cloud project ID"`  
`}`

`variable "region" {`  
  `type        = string`  
  `description = "Region for resources"`  
`}`

`variable "vpc_name" {`  
  `type        = string`  
  `description = "Name of the VPC"`  
`}`

`variable "cidr_block" {`  
  `type        = string`  
  `description = "CIDR block for the VPC"`  
`}`

---

**4\. VPC & Subnet Example**

In this example, we’ll deploy a **VPC with one subnet**.  
 👉 Every resource type (like `aws_vpc`, `aws_subnet`, `google_compute_network`, etc.) is documented in the Terraform Providers Registry.  
 This registry is your **reference for all resource arguments and attributes**.

### **Example (AWS):**

`resource "aws_vpc" "main" {`  
  `cidr_block = var.cidr_block`  
  `tags = {`  
    `Name = var.vpc_name`  
  `}`  
`}`

`resource "aws_subnet" "main" {`  
  `vpc_id            = aws_vpc.main.id`  
  `cidr_block        = "10.0.1.0/24"`  
  `tags = {`  
    `Name = "${var.vpc_name}-subnet"`  
  `}`  
`}`

`output "vpc_id" {`  
  `value       = aws_vpc.main.id`  
  `description = "The ID of the created VPC"`  
`}`

## **5\. Terraform State Management**

* **State file** tracks resources under Terraform’s control.

* **Local state** → default, but unsafe for teamwork.

* **Remote state** → shared backend (e.g., bucket) is required.

⚠️ The backend bucket **must be created before `terraform init`**.  
 You can:

* Create it **manually**, OR

* Use a **script** to create it automatically.  
   👉 After that, you can use `terraform import` to bring the bucket into Terraform state.

Example AWS S3 backend:

`terraform {`  
  `backend "s3" {`  
    `bucket = "team-terraform-state"`  
    `key    = "global/vpc/terraform.tfstate"`  
    `region = var.region`  
  `}`  
`}`

⚠️ A backend block cannot refer to named values (like input variables, locals, or data source attributes). Later, you’ll need to use one backend per environment, so use a separate file in a different folder for your backend configuration and pass it to your terraform CLI: 

**GCP example:**

File: main.tf:

 `terraform {`

  `backend "gcs" {`  
  `}`  
`}`

File: backends/dev.config

`bucket  = "tfstates-gh-demo"`

`prefix  = "terraform/state"`

***terraform init \-backend-config="./backends/dev.config"***

📌 **Notes**

* **State lock (`tfstate.lock`)**

  * Created automatically when running `terraform plan` or `terraform apply`.

  * Prevents multiple concurrent operations against the same state file.

* **`terraform import`**

  * Brings existing infra (like your backend bucket) under Terraform control.

  * Import syntax is always documented in the **Terraform Providers documentation**.

* **`terraform destroy`**

  * Deletes all resources defined in your code.

  * Always test in **dev** first before destroying production resources.

* **Dependencies**

  * Terraform builds a **dependency graph** automatically based on references between resources.  
     Example: if a subnet uses a VPC ID, Terraform knows to create the VPC first  
  * You can override or enforce explicit dependencies using the **`depends_on`** meta-argument:

```
resource "aws_subnet" "main" {
  vpc_id      = aws_vpc.main.id
  cidr_block  = "10.0.1.0/24"
  depends_on  = [aws_vpc.main]
}
```

* Use `depends_on` only when necessary (e.g., when Terraform cannot infer the dependency automatically, such as with provisioners or outputs).

## **6\. Local Setup Testing**

Initialize Terraform:

 `terraform init`

Do a terraform plan and check the result:

`terraform plan -var-file=dev.tfvars` 

Deploy **dev** environment:

 `terraform apply -var-file=dev.tfvars`

Check outputs:

 `vpc_id = vpc-123456`  
`subnet_id = subnet-abcdef`

Destroy when done:

 `terraform destroy -var-file=dev.tfvars`

👉 The infrastructure must be **fully reproducible**:

* One command to create → `terraform apply`

* One command to delete → `terraform destroy`

## **7\. Security & Best Practices**

* Always use variables for **region, project\_id, and CIDRs**.

* Use `sensitive = true` for secrets:  
    
  `variable "db_password" {`

        `type      = string`  
        `sensitive = true`  
      `}`

* Credentials:

  * Local: authenticate with the **cloud CLI**.

  * **Never commit keys**.

* Prefer **short-lived credentials** with identity federation.  
   👉 **For this course, we will not use identity federation (too advanced), but remember this is best practice in production.**

---

## **8\. Advanced Notes**

* **Null resources**:

  * Allow executing arbitrary scripts.

  * Use only as a **last resort** (e.g., unsupported features).

---

## 

## **9\. Key Takeaways**

* Each group works in **one dev project**.

* Backend bucket must be created **manually or via script**, then imported.

* Infra must be **reproducible** (`apply`) and **disposable** (`destroy`).

* Handle credentials securely and consider **region impact on cost, latency, and sustainability**.

* Test your setup progressively (`init/plan`)

* `tfstate.lock` \= prevents concurrent operations.

* **Terraform Providers Docs** \= your official reference for resources and arguments.
