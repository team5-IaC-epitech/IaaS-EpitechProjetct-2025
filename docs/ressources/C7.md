# **Course 7: Load Balancing & Autoscaling in Cloud-Managed Kubernetes Clusters**

---

## **1\. Introduction**

In this course, we’ll explore how **load balancers** manage traffic within a **cloud-managed Kubernetes cluster** and how they enable your **Task Manager** application to scale seamlessly.

You will learn:

* How internet traffic reaches your cluster and is distributed across pods.

* How autoscaling keeps your application performant.

* Different strategies for deploying load balancers, and trade-offs between them.

By the end of this course, you should understand how to expose your application securely to the internet, scale it efficiently, and justify your design choices.

## **2\. Load Balancers in Managed Kubernetes Clusters**

### **2.1 What Is a Load Balancer?**

A **Load Balancer (LB)** distributes incoming requests across multiple backend instances (pods, nodes, instances, serverless services, etc) to:

* Ensure **high availability** (requests continue even if a pod fails).

* Enable traffic management with **horizontal scalability**.

* Improve **performance and fault tolerance**.

---

### **2.2 Load Balancer Integration Models**

There are two main ways to integrate a load balancer with your managed Kubernetes cluster:

#### **Option 1 — Kubernetes-Native Load Balancer**

* Define a Kubernetes `Service` of type `LoadBalancer` or an **Ingress** resource.

* Kubernetes requests the creation of a **cloud-managed external load balancer** automatically via the **cloud controller manager** (depending on your Cloud provider, this automation may be not available).

* Backend targets are updated automatically whenever pods are added or removed.

* Health checks, firewall rules, and routing are automatically handled by the cloud provider.

Example:

`apiVersion: v1`  
`kind: Service`  
`metadata:`  
  `name: task-manager-service`  
`spec:`  
  `type: LoadBalancer`  
  `selector:`  
    `app: task-manager`  
  `ports:`  
    `- port: 80`  
      `targetPort: 8080`

✅ **Pros:**

* Fully integrated with Kubernetes.

* Automatic backend synchronization.

❌ **Cons:**

* Less control over advanced routing and policies.

* Provider-specific behaviors may be opaque.

#### **Option 2 — Cloud-Managed Load Balancer**

* You create the load balancer **directly in the cloud provider** (Terraform).

* Manually attach backend services that point to Kubernetes nodes or NodePorts.

* Define health checks, routing rules, SSL certificates, and security groups yourself.

✅ **Pros:**

* Full control over routing, SSL, and security policies.

* Easier to integrate Kubernetes with other non-Kubernetes services.

❌ **Cons:**

* More complex setup and maintenance.

* Automatic pod-to-backend synchronization may be not provided and requires additional scripting, depending on your cloud provider and configuration.

**Guidance:**  
 You can choose either approach. For your project, think carefully about the **pros and cons**, and be prepared to **justify your choice** during the project defense.

### **2.3 Cloud-Managed Load Balancer services**

* **Google Cloud:** Cloud Load Balancing

* **AWS:** Elastic Load Balancer (ALB/NLB)

## **3\. Load Balancer Placement in the Infrastructure**

* The **external load balancer** sits in the **public subnet** of your VPC.

* Receives requests from the internet and forwards them to the **Kubernetes Service**.

* The Service distributes traffic to **application pods/nodes** running in your Node Pool.

* Your pods process requests independently and interact with the **managed SQL database** via its **private endpoint**.

## **4\. Autoscaling**

Managed clusters (GKE/EKS) allow horizontal autoscaling at two levels:

### **4.1 Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)**

The HPA automatically adjusts the number of pods based on CPU, memory, or custom metrics.

Example:

`apiVersion: autoscaling/v2`  
`kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler`  
`metadata:`  
  `name: task-manager-hpa`  
`spec:`  
  `scaleTargetRef:`  
    `apiVersion: apps/v1`  
    `kind: Deployment`  
    `name: task-manager`  
  `minReplicas: 1`  
  `maxReplicas: 200`  
  `metrics:`  
    `- type: Resource`  
      `resource:`  
        `name: cpu`  
        `target:`  
          `type: Utilization`  
          `averageUtilization: 70`

* Pods are scaled up or down automatically.

* The load balancer automatically routes traffic to new pods.


⚠️ **Important:** For this project, do not rely solely on the HPA and scale only at the pod level. In a cloud-managed cluster, billing is based on **nodes** (active VM instances). Scaling only pods may improve **availability** but will **not optimize costs**.

Your cluster must also be able to **scale nodes automatically** using the **Cluster/Node pool Autoscaler**.

💡 **Tip:** Choose **smaller node instances** (CPU & RAM) because you will most likely want to have only **one or two application pods per node**, and then scaling nodes. This ensures efficient resource usage and cost management.

---

### **4.2 Cluster Autoscaler**

If all nodes are full and new pods cannot be scheduled, the **Autoscaler** automatically adds nodes to your Node Pool.  
 When resources are no longer needed, it scales down nodes to save costs.

⚠️ Node scaling may take a few minutes. During that time, your application must respond gracefully to overload, using **HTTP 429 – Too Many Requests**.

## **5\. Integration with the Application**

* Requests from the internet hit the **external load balancer**.

* The LB distributes requests to **multiple pods/nodes** in your cluster.

* Pods remain **stateless**; data is stored in the **managed SQL database**.

* Each request includes a **correlation\_id** header for tracing and debugging.

* Requests are processed logically according to `request_timestamp`. \=\> 409

## **6\. Best Practices**

 ✅ Expose your app using **LoadBalancer Service** or **Ingress Controller**.  
 ✅ Enable **HTTPS** with SSL certificates (cloud managed, self-signed, external provided).  
 ✅ Use **readiness/liveness probes** to avoid routing traffic to unhealthy pods/nodes.  
 ✅ Ensure full horizontal scaling using **HPA** and **Cluster Autoscaler (Node Pool)**  
 ✅ Return **HTTP** **429** during overload.  
 ✅ Monitor metrics from LB, pods, nodes and trace application requests.  
 ✅ Keep your database private inside the VPC.

## **7\. Key Takeaways**

* **External Load Balancers** route internet traffic to your Kubernetes pods.

* You can choose **Kubernetes-native** or **cloud-managed** LB.

* Autoscaling at pod and node level ensures your application can handle traffic spikes.

* Your Task Manager application must be **secure, stateless, and scalable**.

* Be ready to **justify your load balancer and scaling strategies** during the project defense.  
* You must be able to prove that your application can scale horizontally and follow the requirements during your defense \=\> **Bring your own load testing script for the defense \!**
